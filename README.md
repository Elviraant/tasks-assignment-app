## Welcome to the tasks-assignment-app!

This is a project conducted in order to familiarize with the Django Framework used for Web App Development. 

### The idea
It's a web app created for assigning tasks and projects to your colleagues and employees working in your Department or Direction. This idea was born as a part of the course Analysis and Design of Information Systems while my classmates and I were studying the problems of Greek Municipalities. We figured out that a system for assigning tasks and projects and keeping up with their progress would benefit the workflow and progress within the Municipalities. 

### This project
In this project, I developed the use cases of logging in as a supervisor (Deparment Director or Direction Director), editing projects and task assigned as well as, sending notifications to the assignee and showing them their tasks using the Django Framework. 

### Credits 
For the creation of this idea, credits should also be given to [Dora Andreadi](https://github.com/tandreadi), [Maria Gkoulta](https://github.com/MariaGkoulta) and [Katerina Perikou](https://github.com/kPerikou).
